# Intro to Loom Network
Hello Developer,

This documentation will show you how to easily deploy your dapp to Loom Network and enjoy the benefits of practical blockchain interoperability.

#What is Loom Network?
Loom Network is a multichain interoperability platform — live in production — that's connected to other major blockchains such as Ethereum, Binance Chain, and Tron.

Deploy your dapp just once to Loom Network's Basechain and reach the largest user base possible, so you can simply focus on your dapp development and business growth.

Enjoy having no gas fees for users, 1 – 3 second confirmation times, and automatically get connected to every major blockchain using any kind of wallet

## Overview
Loom DAppChains contain an Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) and allow you to deploy and run smart contracts that compile to EVM bytecode.

## Ethereum virtual machine (EVM)

An EVM consists of a database and the interpreter for EVM bytecode.

The interpreter runs EVM bytecode and is specially designed for creating secure deterministic programs suitable for blockchains. The most popular language for coding EVM smart contracts is Solidity. However, any language that compiles to EVM bytecode can be run by the EVM interpreter.

The database is keyed by addresses for each of the programs that have been deployed on the EVM. The value contains the program's bytecode and any associated data.
