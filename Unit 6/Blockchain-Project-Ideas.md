# Default-Workspace Project ideas.

## 1.) Trusted Crowdfunding Platform Using a Smart Contract

As per trusted reports, 85% of startups delay the delivery, and 14% don’t deliver at all what was promised to the angel investors. 

#### Why Blockchain ? 
Implementing a blockchain-based platform can bring in a change. With blockchain technology, 
investors can know to whom the money is going and how they are spending it.


## 2.) Exact Shipment Location Data / Owner Contract

Most logistics companies today offer only the location details of main locations like collection centre, 
city hubs and sorting facilities.

#### Why Blockchain?

Using blockchain, you can implement a system that collects location data from many interconnected systems and deliver exact location details to the customers. 
The application of this project can be extended to other areas like airlines to find lost baggage, car rentals for tracking rented car etc.




## 3.) Blockchain-Based Voting System

Electronic voting systems have replaced paper-based systems, but even now, 
people doubt the voting system’s ability to secure the data and defend against any attacks.

**Why Blockchain?**

The blockchain-based system can ensure transparent and publicly verifiable elections in the country. 
If implemented successfully, voting can be done using a mobile application that is attached to a blockchain system.
