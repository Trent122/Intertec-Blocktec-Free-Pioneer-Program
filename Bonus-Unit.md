## Overview
Loom DAppChains contain an Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) and allow you to deploy and run smart contracts that compile to EVM bytecode.

## Ethereum virtual machine (EVM)

An EVM consists of a database and the interpreter for EVM bytecode.

The interpreter runs EVM bytecode and is specially designed for creating secure deterministic programs suitable for blockchains. The most popular language for coding EVM smart contracts is Solidity. However, any language that compiles to EVM bytecode can be run by the EVM interpreter.

The database is keyed by addresses for each of the programs that have been deployed on the EVM. The value contains the program's bytecode and any associated data.
